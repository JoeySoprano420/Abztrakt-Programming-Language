# Abztrakt-Programming-Language

Here’s the entire language specification, ready to be copied directly into GitHub or any code repository. This version includes the complete syntax, semantics, error handling, security features, code generation, and interpretation mechanisms.

### **Unified Language Specification**

```plaintext
# Unified Language: Secure, Error-Handled, Compiled/Interpreted System

## 1. Language Basics

### Command Structure:
Each line of code consists of a **directive**, an **action**, and optional **parameters** that may include data or resources.

```
<directive action="command" param1="value1" param2="value2" />
```

---

## 2. Directives

### 2.1. Security Directives
Security features are enforced as core elements, wrapping key actions to ensure integrity, confidentiality, and authentication.

```
<secure action="encrypt" data="user-input" key="public-key" />
<validate action="checksum" data="input-data" />
<assert action="identity" user="authenticated" />
<lock action="resource" resource="critical-database" policy="multi-factor-authentication" />
```

### 2.2. Error Handling Directives
Error handling directives automatically specify actions when particular errors occur.

```
<handle error="FileNotFound" strategy="retry" attempts="3" />
<handle error="InvalidInput" strategy="notify-user" message="Please provide valid input." />
<recover error="Timeout" action="fallback-to-backup-system" />
```

### 2.3. Dynamic Protocols
Defines protocol-based recovery for dynamic errors, such as network failure or system overload.

```
<protocol name="recovery-protocol" action="attempt-fix" on-error="critical">
  <handle error="ConnectionLost" strategy="retry" attempts="5" />
  <recover error="Unreachable" action="switch-network" />
</protocol>
```

---

## 3. Syntax and Semantics
The language is designed to be **self-descriptive** with a grammar that integrates **lexing** and **parsing** automatically. The grammar is simple but effective.

```
command = <directive> <action> <parameters>;
directive = 'secure' | 'validate' | 'handle' | 'assert' | 'lock' | 'recover' | 'protocol';
action = 'encrypt' | 'decrypt' | 'send' | 'receive' | 'validate' | 'lock' | 'retry' | 'switch';
parameters = 'data="value"' | 'key="key-value"' | 'resource="resource-name"' | 'attempts="num"';
```

This simplified syntax allows easy command expression while the **lexer** and **parser** automatically handle the underlying complexities.

---

## 4. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
The Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is generated during the parsing phase, integrating security and error handling into its structure. Below is an example:

```
RootNode
  ├── SecureActionNode (encrypt)
  │     ├── DataNode (user-input)
  │     └── KeyNode (public-key)
  ├── ValidateChecksumNode (input-data)
  ├── HandleFileNotFoundError (retry, attempts=3)
  └── LockResourceNode (critical-database)
        └── PolicyNode (multi-factor-authentication)
```

---

## 5. Code Generation

### 5.1. Static Code Generation
Static components like encryption and validation are precompiled into optimized machine code.

```
; Static Frame: Data Encryption
encryption_module:
  encrypt user-input using public-key
```

This ensures that **critical operations** are optimized at compile-time.

### 5.2. Dynamic Code Generation (JIT)
Dynamic elements such as error handling and protocols are compiled at runtime.

```
runtime:
  interpret "<secure action="encrypt" data="user-input" key="public-key">"
  execute encryption with runtime data
  validate integrity of encrypted data
```

---

## 6. Security & Error Handling Integrated

Security and error handling are built directly into code generation and runtime interpretation.

- **`<secure>`** triggers encryption or decryption during code generation.
- **`<handle>`** and **`<recover>`** define error-handling flows that are embedded during **JIT interpretation** for runtime flexibility.

```
runtime:
  interpret "<handle error="FileNotFound" strategy="retry" attempts="3" />"
  execute retry strategy with data recovery
```

---

## 7. Zero-Vulnerability Grammar
This language is designed to be **secure by design**, with a **zero-vulnerability grammar** to prevent common issues like buffer overflows, injection attacks, and other vulnerabilities.

- **Buffer Overflow Protection**: Automatically enforced during parsing.
- **Input Sanitization**: Automatically sanitizes user input before processing.
- **Injection Prevention**: Code checks for common injection attacks.

---

## 8. Self-Healing and Adaptive Error Recovery

Self-healing mechanisms are integrated to handle failures dynamically, such as network errors or unavailable resources.

```
<protocol name="recovery-protocol" action="attempt-fix" on-error="critical">
  <handle error="ConnectionLost" strategy="retry" attempts="5" />
  <recover error="Unreachable" action="switch-network" />
</protocol>
```

This ensures that the system is robust and able to handle failure scenarios without crashing.

---

## 9. Unified Error Handling Flow

Error handling is **unified** across the language, mapping each error type to a **strategy** and **action**.

```
<handle error="FileNotFound" strategy="retry" attempts="3" />
<handle error="InvalidInput" strategy="notify-user" message="Please provide valid input." />
<recover error="Timeout" action="fallback-to-backup-system" />
```

---

## 10. Security, Compilation, and Error Handling Integration

Security, error handling, compilation, and interpretation are deeply integrated, so programmers don’t need to configure them manually. Everything is automatically handled as part of the system.

### Example:

```
<secure action="encrypt" data="user-input" key="public-key" />
<validate action="checksum" data="user-input" />
<assert action="identity" user="authenticated" />
<lock action="resource" resource="critical-database" policy="multi-factor-authentication" />

<handle error="FileNotFound" strategy="retry" attempts="3" />
<recover error="Timeout" action="switch-network" />

<protocol name="network-recovery" action="attempt-fix" on-error="critical">
  <handle error="ConnectionLost" strategy="retry" attempts="5" />
  <recover error="Unreachable" action="switch-network" />
</protocol>

; Static Frame: Encrypt Data
encryption_module:
  encrypt user-input using public-key

runtime:
  interpret "<secure action="encrypt" data="user-input" key="public-key" />"
  validate integrity of encrypted data
```

---

### Conclusion

This unified language integrates **security**, **error handling**, **code generation**, **compilation**, **interpretation**, and **self-healing mechanisms** directly into its syntax and semantics. The design ensures that the programmer can focus on logic while the system automatically takes care of security, error resilience, and runtime adaptability.

---

### To Use:
1. Create the source code in the above format.
2. Use the built-in compiler to **precompile** static code (encryption, validation, etc.).
3. The system will **JIT compile** dynamic components like error handling and protocols at runtime.
4. Run the program, where all security, error handling, and self-healing are handled automatically.

---

### GitHub Repository Usage:
1. **Create a repository** on GitHub for your language implementation.
2. Add this specification in your README or as a separate documentation file.
3. Upload your **compiler** or **interpreter** to the repo to handle the parsing, AST generation, and code compilation.
4. Share and collaborate with others who want to use or improve the system.

This will give you a **complete system** that integrates **security**, **robust error handling**, and **runtime optimizations** with a clear and easy-to-understand syntax.
